#+title: gis
#+subtitle: Get status information about multiple Git repositories

/gis/ is a Bash script which shows a status summary of multiple Git repositories.

It was inspired by [[https://wiki.ros.org/wstool][wstool]], [[https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool][vcstool]] and the default [[https://starship.rs/][Starship]] prompt.

* Usage

  #+begin_example
    Usage: gis [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]

    Show a status summary of all Git repositories which are found recursively in
    current work directory. If the colon-separated environment variable $GIS_PATH
    is set, the declared directories will be used instead.

    COMMANDS
      fetch  Execute 'git fetch --prune --all' for all found repositories
      pull   Execute 'git pull' for all found repositories which are behind
             upstream, includes 'gis fetch'

    OPTIONS
      -p, --path  PATH  Use PATH for searching Git repositories
      -h, --help        Show this help message and exit
  #+end_example

* Installation

** Manual

   Place the =gis= script in your =$PATH=.
   To use the autocompletion feature source the =gis_completion.bash= script.

   On ZSH additionally the =compinit= and =bashcompinit= modules must be loaded before sourcing the completion script:

   #+begin_src sh
     autoload -U +X compinit && compinit
     autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit
   #+end_src

** Scripts

   Installation scripts for Bash (=install.bash=) and ZSH (=install.zsh=) are provided which will link the two files to =~/.local/{bin/gis,share/bash-completion/completions/gis}= and add the corresponding entries to =~/.bashrc= or =~/.zshrc=.
   Further updates of /gis/ require just =git pull=.

** Nix Flake

   This repository is also a [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][Nix Flake]].
   /gis/ is provided as package under =github:Deleh/gis#gis=.

* Syntax

  #+begin_example
    $ - Dirty stash
    ? - Untracked files
    ! - Local changes
    + - Staged changes
    - - File removed
    = - Both modified
    ⇕ - Diverged from upstream
    ⇡ - Ahead upstream
    ⇣ - Behind upstream
    ✗ - Upstream gone
  #+end_example

  Branches which don't have the same name as the =origin/HEAD= reference are highlighted in yellow.
  You can manually check on which branch you working tree is on by executing the following command:
  : git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD

  Note, that the reference gets only set when the repository is initially cloned and doesn't update with =git fetch=.
  It can be updated manually like this:
  : git remote set-head origin -a

  Or set it manually to any branch with:
  : git remote set-head origin <branch_name>
